I initiated this project with Lockheed Martin as my senior capstone project (graduation project) in 2015. The team consist of 6 senior engineering students: 2 mechanical engineers, 2 computer engineers, and 2 electrical engineers. The scope of the project was to design a underwater vehicle that capable of navigating under the water with live video feed.
